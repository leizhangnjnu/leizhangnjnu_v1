Research
======
I’m currently working on **Computer Vision Theory based on Deep Learning, Wearable Sensor Signal Processing Method based on Deep Learning, etc**. 
Our group has GPU Deep Learning Server (Ubuntu Linux OS, Geforce GTX 1080ti × 1、Geforce RTX 2080ti × 1、Geforce RTX 3090 × 1, etc.). 
M.S student in the research group are also responsible for the daily operation and maintenance of the school's Deep Learning computing server (Geforce RTX 3090 × 4). 
We focus on cultivating students' **practical programming ability (Python, PyTorch + TensorFlow + Keras + Jittor + Caffe, etc.)** in the field of **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**.
M.S students mainly publish papers in the fields of computer and artificial intelligence, based on paper with code mode, which is conducive to further study or 
employment in the field of IT after graduation. For the more specific research direction of M.S students, please 
refer to the <a href="https://leizhangnjnu.github.io//publications/">representative papers</a> of previous M.S students. <br>
