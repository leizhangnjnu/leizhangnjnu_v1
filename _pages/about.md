Postgraduate Training
======

**All graduate students have a solid grasp of Deep Learning related basic programming technology.**
Graduate students mainly go to Internet high-tech enterprises or continue to study for a Ph.D's degree in computer and related fields in 985 universities. 
Some of them got internship offers from **NetEase**, **ZTE**, **Xiaomi**, **The Science and Technology Department in Bank of Nanjing** and other technology
